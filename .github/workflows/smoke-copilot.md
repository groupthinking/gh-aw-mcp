# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **Serena Go Testing**: Use the `serena-go` tool to run a basic go command like "go version" to verify the tool is available
3. **Playwright Testing**: Use playwright to navigate to <https://github.com> and verify the page title contains "GitHub"
4. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-copilot-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Copilot at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
5. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)

## Output

Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author and any assignees

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-copilot` to the pull request.
