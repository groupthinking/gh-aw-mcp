// closeLogFile is a common helper for closing log files with consistent error handling.
// It syncs buffered data before closing and handles errors appropriately.
// The mutex should already be held by the caller.
//
// Error handling strategy:
// - Sync errors are logged but don't prevent closing (ensures resources are released)
// - Close errors are returned to the caller
//
// This ensures consistent behavior across all logger types:
// - Resources are always released (no file descriptor leaks)
// - Sync errors are logged for debugging but don't block cleanup
// - Close errors are propagated to indicate serious issues
func closeLogFile(file *os.File, mu *sync.Mutex, loggerName string) error {
	if file == nil {
		return nil
	}

	// Sync any remaining buffered data before closing
	// Log errors but continue with close to avoid resource leaks
	if err := file.Sync(); err != nil {
		log.Printf("WARNING: Failed to sync %s log file before close: %v", loggerName, err)
	}

	// Always close the file, even if sync failed
	return file.Close()
}
