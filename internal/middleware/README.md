# jqschema Middleware

This middleware package implements the jqschema functionality from the gh-aw shared agentic workflow as a tool call middleware for the MCP Gateway.

## Features

- **Automatic JSON Schema Inference**: Uses the jq schema transformation logic to automatically infer the structure and types of JSON responses
- **Payload Storage**: Stores complete response payloads in `/tmp/gh-awmg/tools-calls/{randomID}/payload.json`
- **Response Rewriting**: Returns a transformed response containing:
  - First 500 characters of the payload (for quick preview)
  - Inferred JSON schema showing structure and types
  - Query ID for tracking
  - File path to complete payload
  - Metadata (original size, truncation status)

## How It Works

The middleware wraps tool handlers and intercepts their responses:

1. **Random ID Generation**: Each tool call gets a unique random ID (32 hex characters)
2. **Original Handler Execution**: The original tool handler is called normally
3. **Payload Storage**: The complete response is saved to disk
4. **Schema Inference**: The jq schema transformation is applied to extract types and structure
5. **Response Rewriting**: A new response is returned with preview + schema

## Usage

The middleware is automatically applied to all backend MCP server tools (except `sys___*` tools).

### Example Response

**Original response:**
```json
{
  "total_count": 1000,
  "items": [
    {
      "login": "user1",
      "id": 123,
      "verified": true
    },
    {
      "login": "user2",
      "id": 456,
      "verified": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Transformed response:**
```json
{
  "queryID": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "payloadPath": "/tmp/gh-awmg/tools-calls/a1b2c3d4e5f6.../payload.json",
  "preview": "{\"total_count\":1000,\"items\":[{\"login\":\"user1\",\"id\":123,\"verified\":true}...",
  "schema": {
    "total_count": "number",
    "items": [
      {
        "login": "string",
        "id": "number",
        "verified": "boolean"
      }
    ]
  },
  "originalSize": 234,
  "truncated": false
}
```

## Implementation Details

### jq Schema Filter

The middleware uses the same jq filter logic as the gh-aw jqschema utility:

```jq
def walk(f):
  . as $in |
  if type == "object" then
    reduce keys[] as $k ({}; . + {($k): ($in[$k] | walk(f))})
  elif type == "array" then
    if length == 0 then [] else [.[0] | walk(f)] end
  else
    type
  end;
walk(.)
```

This recursively walks the JSON structure and replaces values with their type names.

### Go Implementation

The middleware is implemented using [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq), a pure Go implementation of jq, eliminating the need to spawn external processes.

## Configuration

The middleware can be controlled via the `ShouldApplyMiddleware` function:

```go
func ShouldApplyMiddleware(toolName string) bool {
    // Currently excludes sys tools
    return !strings.HasPrefix(toolName, "sys___")
}
```

## Testing

The middleware includes comprehensive tests:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions (random ID generation, schema transformation, payload storage)
- **Integration tests**: Test complete middleware flow with mock handlers
- **Edge cases**: Test error handling, large payloads, truncation behavior

Run tests:
```bash
make test-unit
# or
go test ./internal/middleware/...
```

## Directory Structure

Payloads are stored in:
```
/tmp/gh-awmg/tools-calls/
  ├── {randomID1}/
  │   └── payload.json
  ├── {randomID2}/
  │   └── payload.json
  └── ...
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Token Usage**: Preview + schema is much smaller than full responses
2. **Better Understanding**: Schema shows structure without verbose data
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete payloads are saved for later inspection
4. **Debugging**: Query IDs enable tracking and correlation
5. **Performance**: Pure Go implementation (no external process spawning)
