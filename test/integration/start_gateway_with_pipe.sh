# start_gateway_with_pipe.sh - Launch MCP Gateway with configuration via pipes
#
# This script demonstrates launching the MCP Gateway using different pipe mechanisms:
# 1. Standard pipe (echo | command) - Simple pipe-based configuration
# 2. Named pipe/FIFO (mkfifo) - More robust asynchronous communication
#
# This script is similar in concept to start_mcp_gateway_server.sh from the gh-aw repository,
# providing a reusable way to launch the gateway with dynamic configuration in environments
# where file-based configuration is not suitable (e.g., containerized deployments).
#
# Usage:
#   BINARY=./awmg PORT=8000 MODE=--routed PIPE_TYPE=standard ./start_gateway_with_pipe.sh
#   BINARY=./awmg PORT=8001 MODE=--unified PIPE_TYPE=named ./start_gateway_with_pipe.sh
#
# Environment Variables:
#   BINARY       - Path to the awmg binary (default: ./awmg)
#   HOST         - Host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
#   PORT         - Port to listen on (default: 13100)
#   MODE         - Gateway mode: --routed or --unified (default: --routed)
#   PIPE_TYPE    - Pipe mechanism: standard or named (default: standard)
#   TIMEOUT      - Startup timeout in seconds (default: 30)
#   NO_CLEANUP   - If set to 1, don't cleanup gateway process on exit (for tests)
#   KEEP_RUNNING - If set to 1, keep script running after gateway starts
